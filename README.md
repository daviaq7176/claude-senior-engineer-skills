> **From Bug → Clean → Scalable → Production**

A curated collection of 30 Claude-style skills that mirror how senior engineers *actually* think about code — not just writing it, but understanding, debugging, fixing, refactoring, optimizing, hardening, and reviewing it.

These skills are designed to be used with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or any Claude-powered AI workflow. Each skill is a precise, opinionated instruction set that transforms Claude into a domain-specific expert for a given engineering task.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

Most AI coding prompts are shallow. They say "fix this bug" or "refactor this function" without the depth a senior engineer brings to the table.

This repository encodes the **mental models, constraints, and judgment** of a seasoned engineer into reusable, composable skill files. The result: AI assistance that doesn't just produce code — it produces *correct*, *safe*, *maintainable* code backed by real engineering thinking.

## 🔄 The Pipeline

| Stage | Folder | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| 🔍 **Understand** | `01_understand/` | 4 | Map, analyze, and explain existing code |
| 🐛 **Debug** | `02_debug/` | 4 | Reproduce, trace, and diagnose issues |
| 🔧 **Fix** | `03_fix/` | 4 | Apply targeted, safe, minimal patches |
| ♻️ **Refactor** | `04_refactor/` | 4 | Improve structure without changing behavior |
| ⚡ **Optimize** | `05_optimize/` | 4 | Eliminate bottlenecks and improve efficiency |
| 🛡️ **Harden** | `06_harden/` | 4 | Secure, monitor, and make resilient |
| 🔬 **Review** | `07_review/` | 6 | Architect, test, and future-proof |

## 🚀 How to Use

### With Claude Code

Copy any skill file's content into your Claude Code session as a CLAUDE.md skill, or reference it directly:

```bash
cat skills/02_debug/trace-execution-path.md >> CLAUDE.md
```

### As a System Prompt

Use the skill's **Instructions** section as a system prompt when starting a new Claude conversation focused on that task.

### In a Pipeline

Chain skills together for end-to-end workflows:

```
1. map-code-flow        → understand the system
2. identify-risky-areas → find where to focus
3. reproduce-bug        → confirm the problem
4. trace-execution-path → understand the root cause
5. patch-critical-bug   → apply the fix
6. security-review      → verify no new vulnerabilities
7. automated-test-generation → lock in the fix
```

## 💡 Example Usage

### Scenario: You inherited a broken payment service

```
Step 1 → skills/01_understand/explain-business-logic.md
  "What does this payment flow actually do?"

Step 2 → skills/02_debug/reproduce-bug-from-logs.md
  "Here are the Stripe webhook logs from the failed transactions..."

Step 3 → skills/02_debug/detect-race-conditions.md
  "There's a double-charge happening under load..."

Step 4 → skills/03_fix/patch-critical-bug.md
  "Apply the idempotency fix without touching unrelated code."

Step 5 → skills/06_harden/fail-safe-retry-logic.md
  "Add retry logic with backoff for transient Stripe failures."

Step 6 → skills/07_review/automated-test-generation.md
  "Generate tests covering the race condition and edge cases."
```

## ✨ Why This Is Different

Each skill encodes:
- **Constraints** — what NOT to do (no unnecessary rewrites, preserve behavior, minimal blast radius)
- **Senior-level framing** — how to think about the problem, not just how to execute
- **Structured outputs** — so you always know what you're getting back
- **Real-world focus** — edge cases, concurrency, production failures, legacy code

---

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Copy `templates/skill-template.md`
3. Fill in all sections completely — no vague instructions
4. Place it in the appropriate stage folder
5. Open a PR with: skill name, purpose, and the problem it solves

**Quality bar:** Your skill should read like it was written by a principal engineer who has felt the pain this skill addresses.
